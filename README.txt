This is a work-in-progress for the Vending Machine example,
as highlighted by the Lambda Lounge.

This example uses Groovy, but in a fairly straight-up, Java-esque way.

It leverages the evaluation of strings (as code), and the testing tools.
Not a lot of dynamic or functional style in this project.
